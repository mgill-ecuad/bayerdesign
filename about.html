<h3>About</h3>

<p style = "width: 85%">Herbert Bayer was born on April 5, 1900 in Haag, Austria-Hungary. Bayer was an Austrian-American graphic designer who studied architecture, painting and typography at the Bauhaus from 1919 to 1923. During this time, he designed the Universal alphabet which would become the signature Bauhaus font. He returned as a teacher in 1925, teaching design, typography and advertising. Bayer left his teaching job in 1928 to become the art director of Vogue magazine in Berlin. In 1937, Bayer fled Germany after works of his were included in a Nazi propaganda exhibition that denounced Modernist work. He emigrated to the United States and spent the rest of his career working on various architectural, graphic and interdisciplinary design projects.</p>
